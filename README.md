# 🔒 File Encryption & Decryption GUI Tool

A Python-based graphical application to encrypt and decrypt files with ease using the `cryptography.fernet` library. This tool provides a secure way to manage your files, featuring a modern graphical interface built with `tkinter`.

## ✨ Features

- 🔑 **Key Generation**: Generate a secure encryption key and save it as `key.key`.
- 🛡️ **File Encryption**: Encrypt files to secure sensitive information.
- 🔓 **File Decryption**: Decrypt previously encrypted files to restore original content.
- 🎨 **User-Friendly GUI**: A visually appealing and simple interface for all users.
- 🚀 **Progress Bar Animation**: Get visual feedback during operations.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- 🐍 **Python 3.6+**
- 📦 Required Python Libraries:
  - `cryptography`
  - `tkinter` (bundled with Python by default)

To install the required `cryptography` library:
```bash
pip install cryptography
```

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash

   ```

## 🖥️ How to Use

1. **Generate Key**:
   - Click the "Generate Key" button to create a new encryption key.
   - The key will be saved as `key.key` in the current directory.

2. **Encrypt a File**:
   - Click the "Encrypt File" button.
   - Select the file you want to encrypt.
   - The file will be encrypted and replaced with its encrypted content.

3. **Decrypt a File**:

├── key.key         # Encryption key file (generated during runtime)
```

## ⚠️ Notes

- 🔐 **Keep the Key Safe**: The `key.key` file is critical for encryption and decryption. Losing it will make encrypted files unrecoverable.
- 🧪 **Test First**: Test the tool on non-critical files to familiarize yourself with the process.
