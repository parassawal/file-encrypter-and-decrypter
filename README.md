# 🔒 File Encryption and Decryption Tool

A simple Python-based application to encrypt and decrypt files using the `cryptography.fernet` module. This tool provides an easy way to secure your files by generating a unique encryption key and using it to safeguard your data.

## ✨ Features

- 🔑 **Key Generation**: Generate a secure key and save it to a file (`key.key`).
- 🛡️ **File Encryption**: Encrypt any file to protect its contents.
- 🔓 **File Decryption**: Decrypt encrypted files to restore the original contents.
- 🖥️ **User-Friendly Interface**: Command-line interface for seamless interaction.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- 🐍 Python 3.6 or higher
- 📦 `cryptography` library

Install the `cryptography` library if you don't have it:
```bash
pip install cryptography
```

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **📂 Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
   cd your-repository-name
   ```

2. **▶️ Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **🛠️ Options**:
   - **🔑 Generate Key**: Choose option `1` to generate a new encryption key. The key will be saved as `key.key`.
   - **🛡️ Encrypt File**: Choose option `2` and provide the path of the file to encrypt.
   - **🔓 Decrypt File**: Choose option `3` and provide the path of the file to decrypt.
   - **❌ Exit**: Choose option `4` to exit the application.

### 💡 Example

- **🔐 Encrypt a File**:
  1. Select option `1` to generate a key.
  2. Select option `2` and enter the path of the file to encrypt.
  3. The file will be encrypted, and its contents will be replaced with the encrypted data.

- **🔓 Decrypt a File**:
  1. Select option `3` and enter the path of the encrypted file.
  2. The file will be decrypted, restoring its original contents.

## 📁 File Structure

```
.
├── main.py          # Main script for the application
├── key.key          # Encryption key file (generated after running the app)
```

## ⚠️ Notes

- 🔐 **Keep the Key Safe**: The `key.key` file is crucial for both encryption and decryption. Losing it will render your encrypted files unrecoverable.
- 🧪 **Test Before Use**: Always test the tool on non-critical files before encrypting important data.
